CMSimple
===========

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/modeset/cmsimple.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/modeset/cmsimple)

CMSimple is a easy to use and basic but extendable CMS wrapped around the Mercury editor https://github.com/jejacks0n/mercury

Currently it is in an initial development phase. We believe in open sourcing early and often so here it is with all the kinks of early software.
